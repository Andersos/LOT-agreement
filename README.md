LOT-agreement
=============

LOT ("License on Transfer") Network was established by leading technology companies to reduce the number of patent infringement claims received from non-practicing entities that purchase patents for the sole purpose of enforcing them (called Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs). Companies participating in LOT Network obtain licenses effective upon the transfer of patents by other participants to non-participants, e.g., PAEs.
