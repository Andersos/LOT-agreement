LOT-agreement
=============

LOT ("License on Transfer") Network was established by leading technology companies to reduce the number of patent infringement claims received from non-practicing entities that purchase patents for the sole purpose of enforcing them (called Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs). Companies participating in LOT Network obtain licenses effective upon the transfer of patents by other participants to non-participants, e.g., PAEs. 


License On Transfer Agreement
-----------------------------
Under the [License On Transfer (LOT) Agreement[(), every company that participates grants a license under its patents to the other participants that becomes effective with respect to a particular patent when that patent is transferred to a non-participant, e.g., a patent assertion entity (PAE). This structure protects LOT participants from patent attacks by the non-participant (e.g., a PAE) to which the patent is sold while completely preserving the real business uses of a participant’s patent portfolio.  The Agreement includes value-preserving provisions.  For example, Transfers as part of a Change of Control to a Non-Assertion Entity or qualified M&A are carved out.

The LOT Network is industry-led and independently-run.  The LOT Network members are geographically and technologically diverse; a list of the members can be found here.  Sophisticated patent licensing counsel representing the governing LOT Users and other companies provided input into the agreement.  The LOT Agreement already covers nearly 300,000 patent assets.
